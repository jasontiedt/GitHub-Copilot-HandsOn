## üõí Exercise 3: E-commerce Shopping Cart TDD (30 minutes)

### Goal
Practice test-driven development by implementing tests first, then verifying against existing code.

### Steps
1. **Start with an empty test file** (`ShoppingCartTests.cs` has minimal content)

2. **Generate comprehensive test structure** with this prompt:
   ```
   Generate a complete xUnit test class for ShoppingCart with these test categories:
   
   1. Constructor & Properties Tests:
      - New cart is empty, has zero items
      - IsEmpty property works correctly
   
   2. Add Item Tests:
      - Adding valid product increases item count
      - Adding null product throws ArgumentNullException
      - Adding existing product increases quantity
      - Zero/negative quantity throws ArgumentException
   
   3. Remove Item Tests:
      - Removing existing item works
      - Removing non-existent item returns false
      - Partial quantity removal
      - Complete item removal
   
   4. Calculation Tests:
      - Subtotal calculation with multiple items
      - Discount application with valid/invalid codes
      - Total calculation with tax
      - Empty cart calculations return zero
   
   Use helper methods to create test products. Include Theory tests where appropriate.
   ```

3. **Add advanced scenarios** with this prompt:
   ```
   Add xUnit tests for ShoppingCart edge cases:
   - Products with zero price
   - Very large quantities
   - Decimal precision in price calculations
   - Multiple products same category
   - Cart summary functionality
   - Clearing cart operations
   Use parameterized tests for discount codes
   ```

4. **Run your tests** to verify they work with the existing implementation:
   ```bash
   dotnet test tests/Library.Tests/ShoppingCartTests.cs
   ```

5. **If tests fail**, use AI to debug:
   ```
   My ShoppingCart test is failing with this error: [paste error]
   Here's my test code: [paste test]
   Help me fix the test to match the actual ShoppingCart implementation
   ```

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete test coverage for all public methods
- [ ] Tests verify business rules (discounts, tax calculation)
- [ ] Edge cases handled properly
- [ ] Helper methods reduce code duplication
- [ ] All tests pass with existing implementation

## üå§Ô∏è Exercise 4: Mocking External Dependencies (25 minutes)

### Goal
Learn to test code with external dependencies using Moq framework.

### Steps
1. **Study the existing WeatherService tests** to understand mocking patterns

2. **Add HTTP timeout tests** with this prompt:
   ```
   Generate xUnit tests for WeatherService that test timeout scenarios:
   - HTTP request timeout throws WeatherServiceException
   - Cancelled operations handle CancellationToken properly
   - Long-running requests are cancelled appropriately
   Use Moq to simulate network delays and timeouts
   ```

3. **Test retry logic thoroughly** using this prompt:
   ```
   Create xUnit tests that verify WeatherService retry behavior:
   - Verify exact number of retry attempts (should be 3)
   - Test exponential backoff timing between retries
   - Ensure successful request on retry stops further attempts
   - Verify different HTTP status codes trigger appropriate behavior
   Use Mock.Verify to check call counts and timing
   ```

4. **Add malformed response tests**:
   ```
   Generate tests for WeatherService handling invalid responses:
   - Malformed JSON throws appropriate exception
   - Empty response body handling
   - Missing required fields in JSON
   - Invalid data types in response
   Mock HttpClient to return various malformed responses
   ```

5. **Verify HTTP request details**:
   ```
   Create tests that verify WeatherService makes correct HTTP requests:
   - Correct URL format with API key and city
   - Proper URL encoding for city names with spaces/special chars
   - Request headers are set correctly
   - HTTP method is GET
   Use ItExpr.Is<HttpRequestMessage> to verify request properties
   ```

6. **Run and validate your tests**:
   ```bash
   dotnet test tests/Library.Tests/WeatherServiceTests.cs -v normal
   ```

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Mock setup correctly simulates HTTP responses
- [ ] Retry logic thoroughly tested
- [ ] Exception scenarios covered

   - Calculator (basic math operations)
   - BankAccount (financial transactions)  
   - ShoppingCart (e-commerce functionality)
   - WeatherService (external API calls)
   
   What additional test scenarios should I consider to improve coverage?
   Focus on boundary conditions, error cases, and integration scenarios.
   ```

3. **Add integration tests** with this prompt:
   ```
   Generate integration tests that combine multiple classes:
   - Shopping scenario: Create account, add money, make purchases
   - Error handling: Network failures during weather-dependent shopping
   - Bulk operations: Multiple transactions, large cart operations
   Use real objects instead of mocks where appropriate
   ```

4. **Performance testing** with AI help:
   ```
   Create xUnit tests that verify performance characteristics:
   - ShoppingCart operations complete within reasonable time
   - BankAccount handles many transactions efficiently
