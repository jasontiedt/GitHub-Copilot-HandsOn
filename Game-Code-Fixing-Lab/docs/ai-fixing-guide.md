# AI-Assisted Code Fixing Guide

## Overview
This guide provides strategies and best practices for using AI assistance to fix legacy game code. Learn how to craft effective prompts, interpret AI suggestions, and apply fixes systematically.

## AI Prompting Strategies for Code Fixing

### 1. Context-Rich Problem Description

#### ❌ Poor Prompt
```
"Fix this code"
```

#### ✅ Good Prompt
```
"This C# game code has a bug where modifying collections during iteration causes InvalidOperationException. Here's the problematic code:

[paste code]

The game needs to remove bullets and enemies when they collide, but the current approach crashes. Suggest a safe way to handle object removal during collision detection that maintains game performance."
```

### 2. Specify the Type of Fix Needed

#### Bug Fix Prompts
```
"Diagnose and fix this crash in a Windows Forms game:
[stack trace]
[relevant code]

Focus on:
- Root cause analysis
- Minimal fix that doesn't break other functionality
- Prevention of similar issues"
```

#### Performance Optimization Prompts
```
"This collision detection code is causing performance issues in a real-time game:
[code]

Current performance: 30 FPS with 100 objects
Target performance: 60 FPS with 500+ objects

Suggest optimizations like spatial partitioning, object pooling, or algorithm improvements."
```

#### Refactoring Prompts
```
"This game class violates Single Responsibility Principle and is hard to maintain:
[large class code]

Refactor this using proper OOP principles:
- Separate concerns into different classes
- Maintain existing functionality
- Improve testability and maintainability"
```

### 3. Provide Complete Context

Always include:
- **Error messages** (compilation errors, runtime exceptions)
- **Expected behavior** vs actual behavior
- **Performance constraints** (FPS targets, memory limits)
- **Platform constraints** (.NET version, Windows Forms, etc.)
- **Related code** that interacts with the problematic code

## Effective AI Prompts by Issue Type

### Memory Leaks
```
"This Windows Forms game has memory leaks causing performance degradation over time:

[paste code that creates disposable objects]

Issues to address:
- Graphics objects not disposed
- Event handlers not unsubscribed  
- Timer resources not cleaned up

Implement proper resource disposal using IDisposable pattern and ensure clean shutdown."
```

### Null Reference Exceptions
```
"This game code throws NullReferenceException during gameplay:

[paste stack trace]
[paste relevant code]

Add defensive programming practices:
- Null checking before operations
- Safe navigation operators where appropriate
- Initialization validation
- Graceful error handling for edge cases"
```

### Performance Bottlenecks
```
"This game code is causing frame rate drops:

[paste performance-critical code]

Profiling shows this method takes 20ms per frame (should be <1ms).
Game context: 2D space shooter with up to 1000+ objects

Optimize for:
- Reduced algorithmic complexity
- Fewer memory allocations
- Cache-friendly data access patterns
- SIMD opportunities if applicable"
```

### Thread Safety Issues
```
"This game code has potential race conditions:

[paste multi-threaded code]

The game uses background threads for:
- Asset loading
- AI processing  
- Network communication

Ensure thread safety while maintaining performance for real-time gameplay."
```

## Iterative Problem Solving with AI

### Step 1: Initial Analysis
```
"Analyze this broken game code and identify all issues:

[paste problematic code]

Categorize issues by:
1. Critical bugs (prevent compilation/runtime)
2. Performance problems (cause frame drops)
3. Code quality issues (maintainability)
4. Missing features (gameplay limitations)

Prioritize fixes by impact on game functionality."
```

### Step 2: Focused Fix Requests
For each issue identified, create specific fix requests:

```
"Fix this specific memory leak in the game rendering system:

[paste Graphics object creation code]

Requirements:
- Maintain current rendering functionality
- Proper disposal of all graphics resources
- No performance regression
- Thread-safe if needed"
```

### Step 3: Validation and Testing
```
"Review this fix for the collision detection performance issue:

Original code:
[paste original slow code]

Fixed code:
[paste AI-suggested fix]

Verify:
- Correctness (same collision results)
- Performance improvement (algorithmic complexity)
- Maintainability (code readability)
- No new bugs introduced"
```

### Step 4: Integration Testing
```
"This fix works in isolation but may interact with other game systems:

[paste fixed code]

Check compatibility with:
- Object pooling system
- Rendering pipeline
- Input handling
- Save/load functionality

Suggest integration tests to verify the complete fix."
```

## Specialized Game Development Prompts

### Object Pooling Implementation
```
"Implement object pooling for this bullet system in a 2D shooter:

[paste current bullet creation/destruction code]

Requirements:
- Generic pool that works with different object types
- Configurable pool sizes (initial/max)
- Automatic expansion when needed
- Reset methods for object reuse
- Thread-safe access if required
- Performance monitoring (pool hit rate)"
```

### Collision Detection Optimization
```
"Optimize this brute-force collision detection for a space shooter:

[paste O(n²) collision code]

Game characteristics:
- Up to 1000 bullets and 500 enemies simultaneously
- Objects move predictably (mostly straight lines)
- Collision shapes are simple rectangles/circles
- Need sub-frame precision for fast bullets

Suggest spatial partitioning approach (grid, quadtree, etc.) most suitable for this scenario."
```

### Game Loop Optimization
```
"Improve this game loop for consistent 60 FPS performance:

[paste current game loop code]

Issues:
- Variable frame timing
- Frame rate drops under load
- Input lag during heavy processing

Implement:
- Fixed timestep for physics
- Interpolation for smooth rendering
- Frame rate limiting
- Performance monitoring and adaptive quality"
```

### State Management Refactoring
```
"Refactor this monolithic game class into a proper state machine:

[paste large GameEngine class]

Required states:
- MainMenu
- Playing  
- Paused
- GameOver
- Settings

Implement clean state transitions and proper separation of state-specific logic."

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### Over-Engineering
❌ **Avoid**: "Rewrite this entire game using the latest design patterns"
✅ **Better**: "Fix this specific memory leak while maintaining current architecture"

### Context Loss
❌ **Avoid**: Asking for fixes without providing error messages or symptoms
✅ **Better**: Include full context - error messages, expected behavior, constraints

### Ignoring Performance
❌ **Avoid**: "Make this code more object-oriented" (without considering game performance)
✅ **Better**: "Improve code structure while maintaining 60 FPS performance"

### Blind Implementation
❌ **Avoid**: Copying AI suggestions without understanding them
✅ **Better**: Ask AI to explain the fix and its trade-offs
