## 🤝 Getting Help

**If you get stuck:**
1. **Check the docs/** folder for detailed guidance
2. **Review solutions/** for reference implementations
3. **Try different AI prompts** - rephrasing often helps
4. **Ask in lab-specific README.md** for troubleshooting tips

**If Copilot isn't working well:**
- Provide more context in your prompts
- Break complex problems into smaller pieces
