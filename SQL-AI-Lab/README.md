## 💡 Pro Tips for Success

### Effective AI Prompting for SQL
- **Be specific about your data structure**: "Using the Orders and Customers tables..."
- **Include performance requirements**: "Write an optimized query that..."
- **Specify the SQL dialect**: "Write a SQL Server query that..."
- **Ask for explanations**: "Explain why this query might be slow"

### Best Practices
- **Always test AI-generated queries** on sample data first
- **Review execution plans** for performance implications  
- **Ask AI to explain complex queries** to ensure you understand them
- **Use AI for code reviews**: "What could be improved in this query?"
