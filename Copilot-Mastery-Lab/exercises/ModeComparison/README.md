# Copilot Mode Comparison Exercises

## Exercise 1: Task Implementation Across All Modes

### Objective
Complete the same task using Chat, Edit, and Agent modes to understand their strengths and differences.

### The Task: Shopping Cart Feature
Implement a shopping cart system with these requirements:
- Add/remove items
- Calculate totals with tax
- Apply discount codes
- Persist cart state
- Include unit tests

### Part A: Chat Mode Implementation

#### Step 1: Planning Discussion
Start a chat conversation with prompts like:
```
"I need to implement a shopping cart feature for an e-commerce site. 
What are the key components I should consider?"
```

Follow up with questions about:
- Data structure design
- Business logic organization
- Error handling strategies
- Testing approaches

#### Step 2: Guided Implementation
Ask for specific guidance:
```
"Can you help me design the ShoppingCart class interface? 
What methods and properties should it have?"
```

```
"How should I handle tax calculation? Should it be a separate service?"
```

```
"What's the best way to implement discount codes with different types 
(percentage, fixed amount, buy-one-get-one)?"
```

#### Your Task
1. Have a planning conversation about the shopping cart
2. Ask for implementation guidance on each component
3. Request code examples for specific parts
4. Document the conversation flow and insights gained

### Part B: Edit Mode Implementation

#### Step 1: Create Basic Structure
Start with a simple shopping cart class:

```csharp
public class ShoppingCart
{
    public void AddItem(string productId, int quantity)
    {
        // TODO: Implement
    }
    
    public decimal GetTotal()
    {
        // TODO: Implement
        return 0;
    }
}
```

#### Step 2: Use Edit Mode to Enhance
Use specific edit instructions:

1. "Add properties for cart items and implement AddItem method"
2. "Implement RemoveItem and UpdateQuantity methods"
3. "Add tax calculation with configurable tax rate"
4. "Implement discount code functionality"
5. "Add persistence methods (SaveCart, LoadCart)"

#### Your Task
1. Start with minimal code structure
2. Use edit mode to progressively enhance functionality
3. Make 5-6 specific edit requests
4. Document what worked well and what was challenging

### Part C: Agent Mode Implementation

#### Step 1: Comprehensive Task Description
Provide a complete specification:

```
Create a complete shopping cart system with the following requirements:

Business Requirements:

## Exercise 2: Debugging Scenario Comparison

### Objective
Compare how different modes handle debugging and problem-solving.

### The Problem
You have a web API that's intermittently returning 500 errors. Here's the problematic code:

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class UsersController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IUserService _userService;
    
    public UsersController(IUserService userService)
    {
        _userService = userService;
    }
    
    [HttpGet("{id}")]
    public async Task<ActionResult<User>> GetUser(int id)
    {
        var user = await _userService.GetUserAsync(id);
        return Ok(user);
    }
    
    [HttpPost]
    public async Task<ActionResult<User>> CreateUser(CreateUserRequest request)
    {
        var user = await _userService.CreateUserAsync(request.Name, request.Email);
        return CreatedAtAction(nameof(GetUser), new { id = user.Id }, user);
    }
}

public class UserService : IUserService
{
    private readonly IUserRepository _repository;
    
    public UserService(IUserRepository repository)
    {
        _repository = repository;
    }
    
    public async Task<User> GetUserAsync(int id)
    {
        return await _repository.FindByIdAsync(id);
    }
    
    public async Task<User> CreateUserAsync(string name, string email)
    {
        var user = new User { Name = name, Email = email };
        await _repository.AddAsync(user);
        return user;
    }
}
```

Error logs show:
- NullReferenceException in GetUser method
- ArgumentException in CreateUser method
- Intermittent database timeout exceptions

### Part A: Chat Mode Debugging
Start a conversation about the debugging process:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   ```
   "I have a web API with intermittent 500 errors. Here's the code [paste code]. 
   The error logs show NullReferenceException, ArgumentException, and database timeouts. 
   How should I approach debugging this?"
   ```

2. **Follow-up Questions**:
   - Ask about specific error patterns
   - Request debugging strategies
   - Discuss potential root causes
   - Get recommendations for logging improvements

### Part B: Edit Mode Debugging
Use edit mode to fix specific issues:

1. "Add null checking and proper error handling to the GetUser method"
2. "Add input validation to the CreateUser method"
3. "Implement proper exception handling with appropriate HTTP status codes"
4. "Add logging to track method execution and identify bottlenecks"

### Part C: Agent Mode Debugging
Provide a comprehensive debugging task:

```
Analyze and fix this web API controller that's experiencing intermittent 500 errors.

Issues Identified:
- NullReferenceException in GetUser
- ArgumentException in CreateUser  
- Database timeout exceptions

Requirements:
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Implement proper input validation

{
    public string ProcessOrder(string orderData)
    {
        var order = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<Order>(orderData);
        
        if (order.Items.Count == 0)
            return "ERROR";
            
        var total = 0.0;
        foreach (var item in order.Items)
        {
            total += item.Price * item.Quantity;
        }
        
        if (order.CustomerType == "Premium")
            total = total * 0.9;
            
        var tax = total * 0.08;
        total += tax;
        
        var result = new
        {
            OrderId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
            Total = total,
            Tax = tax,
            Status = "Processed"
        };
        
        return JsonConvert.SerializeObject(result);
    }
}
