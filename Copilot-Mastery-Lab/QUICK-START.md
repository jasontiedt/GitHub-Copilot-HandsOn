# Quick Start Guide - Copilot Mastery Lab

## 5-Minute Quick Start

### Step 1: Choose Your Learning Path (1 minute)
- **New to AI coding?** â†’ Start with `/exercises/BasicPrompting/`
- **Want to compare models?** â†’ Jump to `/src/ModelComparison/`
- **Interested in interaction modes?** â†’ Go to `/exercises/ModeComparison/`
- **Need practical templates?** â†’ Check `/templates/prompt-templates.md`

### Step 2: Set Up Your Environment (2 minutes)
1. Ensure GitHub Copilot is active in VS Code
2. Open this lab folder in VS Code
3. Run `dotnet restore` in the terminal
4. Open any `.cs` file to activate Copilot

### Step 3: Try Your First Exercise (2 minutes)
Open `/src/PromptingExamples/PromptingPlayground.cs` and try this:

```csharp
// Create a method that validates email addresses using regex
// Return true if valid, false if invalid
// Include validation for @ symbol, domain, and basic format
```

Watch Copilot generate the method and compare it to what you expected!

## 15-Minute Deep Dive

### Minutes 1-5: Basic Prompting Practice
1. Open `/exercises/BasicPrompting/README.md`
2. Complete Exercise 1: Prompt Clarity Comparison
3. Try both poor and good prompts
4. Document the differences you observe

### Minutes 6-10: Model Comparison
1. Open `/src/ModelComparison/ModelComparisonPlayground.cs`
2. Try the same prompt with different models:
   - Ask GPT-4 in Chat
   - Use Claude for code review
   - Use base Copilot for quick implementation
3. Compare the responses

### Minutes 11-15: Interaction Modes
1. Pick one task (e.g., "create a shopping cart class")
2. Try implementing it three ways:
   - **Chat**: Discuss approach first
   - **Edit**: Start with basic code, enhance iteratively
   - **Agent**: Provide complete requirements
3. Note which approach felt most natural

## 30-Minute Comprehensive Introduction

### Phase 1: Foundation (10 minutes)
1. **Read the guides**:
   - `/docs/PROMPTING-GUIDE.md` (key sections)
   - `/docs/MODEL-GUIDE.md` (decision tree)
   - `/docs/MODE-GUIDE.md` (comparison matrix)

2. **Set up workspace**:
   - Ensure all models are available
   - Test Chat, Edit, and Agent modes
   - Familiarize yourself with switching between models

### Phase 2: Hands-on Practice (15 minutes)
1. **Prompting Mastery** (5 minutes):
   - Complete 2-3 exercises from `/exercises/BasicPrompting/`
   - Focus on context optimization and iterative refinement

2. **Model Comparison** (5 minutes):
   - Use `/src/ModelComparison/` playground
   - Try same task with 2-3 different models
   - Document key differences

3. **Mode Exploration** (5 minutes):
   - Complete one exercise from `/exercises/ModeComparison/`
   - Experience the workflow differences

### Phase 3: Template Application (5 minutes)
1. **Choose a template** from `/templates/prompt-templates.md`
2. **Apply it** to a real coding scenario
3. **Customize** the template for your needs
4. **Save** your customized version for future use

2. **Agent Mode**: Generate initial implementation
3. **Edit Mode**: Refine and optimize
4. **Claude**: Security and quality review

### Scenario 2: "I'm learning a new technology"
**Recommended Path**:
1. **Chat with GPT-4**: Get comprehensive explanation
2. **Base Copilot**: Try practical examples
3. **Claude**: Understand best practices and pitfalls
4. **Edit Mode**: Practice implementing patterns

### Scenario 3: "I need to fix existing code"
**Recommended Path**:
1. **Chat Mode**: Analyze the problem
2. **Claude**: Identify issues and risks
3. **Edit Mode**: Make targeted fixes
4. **GPT-4**: Optimize and improve architecture

### Scenario 4: "I want to improve code quality"
**Recommended Path**:
1. **Claude**: Comprehensive code review
2. **GPT-4**: Architecture and performance analysis
3. **Edit Mode**: Apply specific improvements
4. **Agent Mode**: Generate comprehensive tests

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "I'm not getting good responses"
- **Check your context**: Are you providing enough relevant information?
- **Be more specific**: Replace vague requests with detailed requirements
- **Try a different model**: Maybe you need Claude's analysis vs GPT-4's reasoning
- **Use templates**: Start with proven prompt patterns

### "The code doesn't work as expected"
- **Review and test**: Always validate generated code
- **Provide feedback**: Use follow-up prompts to fix issues
- **Add constraints**: Specify error handling, validation, performance needs
- **Iterate**: Refine your prompts based on results

### "I don't know which model to use"
- **Start with base Copilot** for routine tasks
- **Use Chat mode** to explore and decide
- **Try multiple models** for the same task and compare
- **Check the decision tree** in `/docs/MODEL-GUIDE.md`

### "The responses are too generic"
- **Add more context** about your specific project
- **Include examples** of your preferred patterns
- **Specify constraints** like frameworks, standards, performance requirements
- **Use domain-specific terminology**
