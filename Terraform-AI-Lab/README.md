## 💡 Pro Tips for AI-Assisted IaC

### Effective Prompting for Infrastructure
- **Be specific about cloud provider**: "Create an AWS VPC with public and private subnets"
- **Include compliance requirements**: "Generate Azure infrastructure that meets SOC 2 compliance"
- **Specify performance needs**: "Design a high-availability architecture for 10,000 concurrent users"
- **Ask for best practices**: "What security improvements should I make to this infrastructure?"

### Infrastructure Development Workflow
1. **🎯 Define requirements** - Clearly specify what infrastructure you need
2. **🤖 Generate with AI** - Use Copilot to create initial Terraform configuration
3. **🔍 Review and validate** - Check configuration against best practices
4. **📋 Plan deployment** - Run `terraform plan` to preview changes
5. **🚀 Deploy infrastructure** - Apply changes with `terraform apply`
6. **📊 Monitor and optimize** - Use AI to suggest improvements and cost optimizations
