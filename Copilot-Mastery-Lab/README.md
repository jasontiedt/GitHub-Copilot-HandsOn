# GitHub Copilot Mastery Lab

## **AI Partnership Development Philosophy**

This lab teaches you to become an **independent AI collaborator** rather than following prescriptive prompts. You'll develop your own strategies for leveraging GitHub Copilot's full potential.

**⏱️ Duration**: 1-1.5 hours | **📊 Focus**: Independent AI mastery development

## **What You'll Develop**

- **Strategic Prompting**: Create your own effective prompting approaches for various scenarios
- **Model Understanding**: Learn to choose and optimize different Copilot models independently
- **Mode Mastery**: Develop expertise in Chat, Edit, and Agent modes through experimentation
- **Context Optimization**: Build skills in providing AI with optimal context
- **Advanced Workflows**: Design your own multi-feature Copilot workflows

## **Learning Through Discovery**

### 🧠 **Think First, Then Experiment**
- **Analyze your needs** before choosing prompting strategies
- **Experiment** with different approaches to find what works for you
- **Develop intuition** about when to use different Copilot features
- **Build personal patterns** that enhance your productivity

### 🎯 **Your AI Partnership Development**
- **Problem Analysis**: Learn to break down coding challenges for AI collaboration
- **Solution Exploration**: Use AI to explore multiple approaches to problems
- **Quality Validation**: Develop skills to evaluate and improve AI suggestions
- **Workflow Integration**: Create seamless AI-assisted development processes

## **Independent Learning Structure**

### **🤔 Discovery-Based Exercises**
Instead of following step-by-step instructions, you'll:

1. **🧪 Experiment** with different prompting approaches
2. **🔬 Analyze** which strategies work best for different scenarios
3. **📊 Compare** model behaviors and capabilities
4. **🎯 Develop** personal AI collaboration patterns
5. **🚀 Apply** your learnings to real development challenges

### **💡 Learning Philosophy**
- **Question-driven exploration** rather than instruction-following
- **Personal discovery** of effective AI collaboration patterns
- **Iterative improvement** of your AI partnership skills
- **Strategic thinking** about when and how to use AI assistance

## **Getting Started with Discovery**

1. **Prerequisites Assessment**:
   - GitHub Copilot subscription and access
   - VS Code with GitHub Copilot extension
   - .NET 8.0 SDK for practical experimentation
   - **Curiosity and willingness to experiment**

2. **Your Learning Environment**:
   ```bash
   cd Copilot-Mastery-Lab
   dotnet restore
   code .
   ```

3. **Begin Your AI Partnership Journey**:
   - **Explore** the documentation to understand possibilities
   - **Experiment** with exercises using your own approach
   - **Develop** personal strategies through practice
   - Practice with `src/` examples
   - Use `templates/` as reference

## Quick Start Exercises

1. **Basic Prompting** (5 minutes)
2. **Model Comparison** (10 minutes)
3. **Mode Exploration** (15 minutes)
4. **Advanced Workflows** (20 minutes)
