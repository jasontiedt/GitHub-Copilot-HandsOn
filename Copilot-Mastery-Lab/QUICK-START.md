# Quick Start Guide - Copilot Mastery Lab

Welcome! This lab will teach you to become highly effective with GitHub Copilot. Choose your learning path based on available time.

## âš¡ 5-Minute Quick Start

### Step 1: Verify Setup (1 minute)
1. **Open VS Code** in this lab folder
2. **Check Copilot status** in bottom-right of VS Code (should show Copilot icon)
3. **If Copilot isn't active**: Click the icon and sign in to GitHub

### Step 2: Test Basic Functionality (2 minutes)
1. **Create a new file** called `test.cs`
2. **Type this comment**: `// Create a function that calculates compound interest`
3. **Press Enter** and wait for Copilot to suggest code
4. **Press Tab** to accept the suggestion
5. **Success?** You're ready! **No suggestion?** Check Step 1 again.

### Step 3: Try Your First Real Exercise (2 minutes)
1. **Open** `/src/PromptingExamples/PromptingPlayground.cs`
2. **Find the comment** that says `// TODO: Your first exercise`
3. **Replace it with**: 
   ```csharp
   // Create a method that validates email addresses using regex
   // Return true if valid, false if invalid
   // Include validation for @ symbol, domain, and basic format
   ```
4. **Watch Copilot generate** the method automatically!
5. **Compare** what it created to what you expected

**ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations!** You've completed your first AI-assisted coding task.

## ðŸš€ 15-Minute Deep Dive

### Minutes 1-5: Learn Effective Prompting
1. **Open** `/exercises/BasicPrompting/README.md`
2. **Read** the "Good vs Bad Prompts" section
3. **Try both examples** in your playground file:
   - Poor prompt: `// validate email`
   - Good prompt: `// Create a robust email validation method that checks for @ symbol, domain format, and common email rules`
4. **Notice the difference** in code quality and completeness

### Minutes 6-10: Compare AI Models
1. **Open Chat** (Ctrl+Shift+I in VS Code)
2. **Ask the same question to different models**:
   - "Create a shopping cart class with add/remove items functionality"
3. **Try these models** (use @ symbol in Chat):
   - `@workspace` - Uses your project context
   - Choose GPT-4 or Claude from model selector
4. **Compare responses** - which gave better code structure?

### Minutes 11-15: Explore Interaction Modes
**Pick one task**: "Create a simple calculator class"

**Try each mode**:
1. **Chat Mode**: 
   - Ask "How should I structure a calculator class?"
   - Discuss the approach before coding
2. **Edit Mode**: 
   - Start with `public class Calculator { }`
   - Use inline suggestions to enhance it
3. **Agent Mode**: 
   - Give complete requirements: "Create a calculator class with add, subtract, multiply, divide methods, error handling, and unit tests"

**Reflect**: Which mode felt most natural for this task?

## 30-Minute Comprehensive Introduction

### Phase 1: Foundation (10 minutes)
1. **Read the guides**:
   - `/docs/PROMPTING-GUIDE.md` (key sections)
   - `/docs/MODEL-GUIDE.md` (decision tree)
   - `/docs/MODE-GUIDE.md` (comparison matrix)

2. **Set up workspace**:
   - Ensure all models are available
   - Test Chat, Edit, and Agent modes
   - Familiarize yourself with switching between models

### Phase 2: Hands-on Practice (15 minutes)
1. **Prompting Mastery** (5 minutes):
   - Complete 2-3 exercises from `/exercises/BasicPrompting/`
   - Focus on context optimization and iterative refinement

2. **Model Comparison** (5 minutes):
   - Use `/src/ModelComparison/` playground
   - Try same task with 2-3 different models
   - Document key differences

3. **Mode Exploration** (5 minutes):
   - Complete one exercise from `/exercises/ModeComparison/`
   - Experience the workflow differences

### Phase 3: Template Application (5 minutes)
1. **Choose a template** from `/templates/prompt-templates.md`
2. **Apply it** to a real coding scenario
3. **Customize** the template for your needs
4. **Save** your customized version for future use

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "I'm not getting good responses"
- **Check your context**: Are you providing enough relevant information?
- **Be more specific**: Replace vague requests with detailed requirements
- **Try a different model**: Maybe you need Claude's analysis vs GPT-4's reasoning
- **Use templates**: Start with proven prompt patterns

### "The code doesn't work as expected"
- **Review and test**: Always validate generated code
- **Provide feedback**: Use follow-up prompts to fix issues
- **Add constraints**: Specify error handling, validation, performance needs
- **Iterate**: Refine your prompts based on results

### "I don't know which model to use"
- **Start with base Copilot** for routine tasks
- **Use Chat mode** to explore and decide
- **Try multiple models** for the same task and compare
- **Check the decision tree** in `/docs/MODEL-GUIDE.md`

### "The responses are too generic"
- **Add more context** about your specific project
- **Include examples** of your preferred patterns
- **Specify constraints** like frameworks, standards, performance requirements
- **Use domain-specific terminology**
