- What are the essential stages: build, test, artifacts?
- How should the pipeline respond to different triggers?
- What quality gates are most important?

### Part A: GitHub Actions Pipeline (15 minutes)

#### **Your Challenge**: Create Your First Workflow

**Analyze the Problem:**
You need to create `.github/workflows/basic-ci.yml` that provides automated validation for every code change.

**Think About:**
- What events should trigger this pipeline?
- What steps are essential for validating .NET code?
- How should test results be preserved and reported?
- What artifacts need to be created for future use?

**Effective Prompting Approach:**

1. **Context-Rich Opening:**
   ```
   "I need to create a GitHub Actions CI workflow for a .NET 8 Web API application. 
   The pipeline should implement standard CI practices including automated builds, 
   comprehensive testing, and artifact generation. What would be a robust workflow 
   structure that follows GitHub Actions best practices?"
   ```

2. **Enhancement Questions:**
   - "What are the essential components every .NET CI pipeline should include?"
   - "How should I structure jobs for optimal performance and readability?"
   - "What GitHub Actions are recommended for .NET development workflows?"
   - "How can I ensure proper error handling and meaningful status reporting?"

3. **Deep Dive Prompts:**
   - "Explain the purpose and configuration of each action you recommended"
   - "How would you modify this workflow for better caching and performance?"
   - "What security considerations should I include in this CI pipeline?"

</details>

#### **Your Challenge**: Enhance with Advanced Features

**Think About What Makes Pipelines Production-Ready:**
- How can you validate code quality beyond just compilation?
- What security scans should be integrated early in the process?
- How do you handle multiple operating systems efficiently?
- What metrics and reporting enhance team visibility?

**Advanced Feature Development:**

1. **Multi-OS Strategy:**
   ```
   "I want to enhance my GitHub Actions workflow to run on multiple operating systems 
   for better compatibility validation. How should I implement a matrix strategy that 
   efficiently tests across Windows, Ubuntu, and macOS while avoiding redundant work?"
   ```

2. **Quality Integration:**
   ```
   "Add comprehensive code quality checks to my CI pipeline including static analysis, 
   dependency vulnerability scanning, and code formatting validation. What tools and 
   GitHub Actions would you recommend for a .NET project?"
   ```

3. **Performance Optimization:**
   ```
   "How can I optimize this GitHub Actions workflow for faster execution times? 
   Include caching strategies, parallel execution, and conditional logic."
   ```

</details>
# Add steps for:
# - Code formatting validation (dotnet format)
# - Static code analysis
# - Dependency vulnerability scanning
```

### Part B: Azure Pipelines (15 minutes)

#### **Your Challenge**: Create Azure DevOps Pipeline

**Analyze the Different Platform:**
Azure Pipelines offers different capabilities than GitHub Actions. Consider:
- How do Azure Pipeline stages differ from GitHub Actions jobs?
- What are the advantages of multi-stage pipelines?
- How does agent selection impact performance and cost?
- What Azure-specific integrations could add value?

<details>
<summary>üí° Click for Azure Pipeline Prompting Strategies</summary>

**Azure-Specific Development:**

1. **Platform Comparison Prompt:**
   ```
   "I need to create an Azure DevOps pipeline equivalent to my GitHub Actions workflow. 
   Help me understand the key differences in structure, syntax, and capabilities between 
   Azure Pipelines and GitHub Actions for .NET development. What would be the optimal 
   Azure Pipeline implementation?"
   ```

2. **Multi-Stage Architecture:**
   ```
   "Design a multi-stage Azure Pipeline for a .NET application that separates concerns 
   into distinct stages: Build, Test, Quality Gates, and Artifact Publishing. Explain 
   the benefits of this approach and how to implement proper stage dependencies."
   ```

3. **Enterprise Features:**
   ```
   "What enterprise-grade features can I implement in Azure Pipelines that enhance 
   security, compliance, and governance for a production .NET application? Include 
   service connections, variable groups, and approval processes."
   ```
