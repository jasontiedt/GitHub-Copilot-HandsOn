- **Request best practices**: "Follow DevOps best practices for enterprise deployment"

### Pipeline Development Workflow
1. **🎯 Define requirements** - What needs to be built, tested, and deployed?
2. **🤖 Generate with AI** - Use Copilot to create initial pipeline structure
3. **🔍 Review and customize** - Adapt generated code for your specific needs
4. **🧪 Test locally** - Validate pipeline logic before committing
5. **🚀 Deploy and monitor** - Run pipeline and observe results
6. **📊 Optimize and iterate** - Use AI to improve performance and reliability
