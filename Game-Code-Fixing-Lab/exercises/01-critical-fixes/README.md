# Exercise 1: Critical Bug Fixes

## Objective
Fix the critical bugs that prevent the game from running or cause immediate crashes. Use AI assistance to diagnose and resolve these issues quickly.

## Pre-Exercise Setup
1. Try to build the project: `dotnet build`
2. Try to run the game: `dotnet run`
3. Observe the compilation errors and runtime crashes

## Critical Issues to Fix

### ðŸš¨ Issue 1: Compilation Errors
The project won't even compile due to several errors.

**AI Prompt to Use**:
```
"Analyze this C# code and fix all compilation errors. The code is trying to modify anonymous object properties which is not allowed in C#:

[Copy the GameEngine.cs UpdateGame method]

Suggest a proper fix that maintains the same functionality."
```

**Expected Problems**:
- Anonymous objects are immutable
- Can't modify properties of anonymous objects
- Type casting issues with `dynamic`

**Fix Strategy**:
- Replace anonymous objects with proper classes
- Use strongly typed objects instead of `dynamic`
- Implement proper object-oriented design

### ðŸš¨ Issue 2: Collection Modification During Iteration
The collision detection tries to modify collections while iterating.

**AI Prompt to Use**:
```
"This code has a bug where it modifies a collection while iterating over it:

[Copy the CheckCollisions method from GameEngine.cs]

Fix this issue and suggest a better approach for handling object removal during collision detection."
```

**Expected Problems**:
- `InvalidOperationException` when removing items during foreach
- Lost collision detections
- Inconsistent game state

**Fix Strategy**:
- Use reverse iteration with for loops
- Mark objects for removal and clean up separately
- Implement proper object lifecycle management

### ðŸš¨ Issue 3: Memory Leaks in Graphics
Graphics objects are created but never disposed.

**AI Prompt to Use**:
```
"This Windows Forms game code has memory leaks with Graphics objects:

[Copy the GameEngine constructor and Paint method]

Identify all the memory leaks and implement proper resource disposal using IDisposable pattern."
```

**Expected Problems**:
- `Graphics` objects not disposed
- `Font` objects created repeatedly
- `Bitmap` objects not disposed
- Timer not disposed on form close

**Fix Strategy**:
- Implement `IDisposable` pattern
- Use `using` statements for graphics objects
- Proper cleanup in form close events

### ðŸš¨ Issue 4: NullReferenceException Crashes
Multiple places where null reference exceptions can occur.

**AI Prompt to Use**:
```
"Review this game code for potential NullReferenceException issues:

[Copy Player.cs and Enemy.cs collision methods]

Add proper null checking and defensive programming practices."
```

**Expected Problems**:
- No null checks before calling methods
- Uninitialized objects
- Race conditions with object removal

**Fix Strategy**:
- Add null checks before operations
- Initialize objects properly
- Use null-conditional operators where appropriate

### ðŸš¨ Issue 5: Timer Configuration Issues
Game timer is not configured correctly for smooth gameplay.

**AI Prompt to Use**:
```
"This game timer setup is incorrect for 60 FPS gameplay:

private int GAME_SPEED = 16;
this.gameTimer.Interval = GAME_SPEED;

Fix the timer configuration and explain the correct way to achieve 60 FPS in a Windows Forms game."
```

**Expected Problems**:
- Incorrect FPS calculation
- Inconsistent frame timing
- Performance issues

**Fix Strategy**:
- Calculate correct millisecond intervals
- Consider using higher resolution timers
- Implement frame time tracking

## Step-by-Step Fixing Process

### Step 1: Fix Compilation Errors
1. **Run build command** and identify all compilation errors
2. **Use AI assistance** to understand each error
3. **Fix anonymous object issues** by creating proper classes
4. **Replace dynamic usage** with strongly typed objects
5. **Verify compilation** succeeds

**AI Prompts for Step 1**:
```
"Convert this anonymous object usage to a proper class structure:
var player = new { X = 400, Y = 500, Width = 50, Height = 30, Health = 100 };"

"Replace this dynamic casting with proper type-safe code:
dynamic playerObj = (dynamic)this.player;
playerObj.X += 10;"
```

### Step 2: Fix Collection Modification Bugs
1. **Identify all foreach loops** that modify collections
2. **Use AI to suggest safe alternatives**
3. **Implement proper removal patterns**
4. **Test that objects are removed correctly**

**AI Prompts for Step 2**:
```
"Fix this collection modification during iteration bug:
foreach (var bulletObj in this.bullets)
{
    foreach (var enemyObj in this.enemies)
    {
        if (collision detected)
        {
            this.bullets.Remove(bulletObj); // BUG: Modifying during iteration
            this.enemies.Remove(enemyObj);
        }
    }
}"

"Suggest a proper pattern for marking and removing game objects safely."
```

### Step 3: Implement Resource Disposal
1. **Identify all IDisposable resources**
2. **Implement proper disposal patterns**
3. **Add cleanup code to form close event**
4. **Test for memory leaks**

**AI Prompts for Step 3**:
```
"Implement proper IDisposable pattern for this game engine class that uses Graphics, Timer, and Bitmap resources."

"Show me how to properly dispose of Windows Forms graphics resources in a game loop."
```

### Step 4: Add Null Safety
1. **Review all object interactions**
2. **Add null checks where needed**
3. **Use defensive programming practices**
4. **Test error scenarios**

**AI Prompts for Step 4**:
```
"Add comprehensive null checking to this collision detection code:
public bool CollidesWith(Enemy enemy)
{
    return this.X < enemy.X + enemy.Width && // Potential null reference
           this.X + this.Width > enemy.X &&
           this.Y < enemy.Y + enemy.Height &&
           this.Y + this.Height > enemy.Y;
}"
```

### Step 5: Fix Timer and Performance Issues
1. **Calculate correct timer intervals**
2. **Implement proper FPS control**
3. **Add performance monitoring**
4. **Test smooth gameplay**

**AI Prompts for Step 5**:
```
"Fix this game timer setup for smooth 60 FPS gameplay:
this.gameTimer = new Timer();
this.gameTimer.Interval = 16;

Also suggest improvements for consistent frame timing."
```

## Testing Your Fixes

### Build Test
```bash
# Should compile without errors
dotnet build
```

### Runtime Test
```bash
# Should run without immediate crashes
dotnet run
```

### Basic Functionality Test
- Game window should open
- Player should be visible (blue rectangle)
- Enemies should be visible (red rectangles)
- Game should not crash immediately

## Verification Checklist
