# CI/CD Pipelines AI Lab - Solution Cheat Sheet ‚öôÔ∏è

**For Instructors & Advanced Learners**

This cheat sheet provides example solutions and effective DevOps prompting strategies while maintaining the lab's independent learning philosophy.

## üéØ **Learning Objectives Validation**

Students should demonstrate:
- **Strategic pipeline architecture** planning with AI assistance
- **Independent analysis** of DevOps requirements before implementation
- **Iterative improvement** of CI/CD strategies based on AI feedback
- **Cross-platform thinking** for pipeline design and optimization

## üìö **Exercise 1: Basic CI Pipeline (25 minutes)**

### **Effective GitHub Actions Prompts**

#### **Comprehensive CI Strategy**
```
"I need to design a GitHub Actions CI pipeline for a .NET 8 Web API that implements 
industry-standard practices. The pipeline should include automated builds, comprehensive 
testing with coverage reporting, security scanning, and artifact management. Help me 
understand the essential components and their optimal organization for maintainability 
and performance."
```

#### **Cross-Platform Considerations**
```
"Design a CI workflow that efficiently tests across Windows, Linux, and macOS while 
minimizing build time and resource usage. Include intelligent caching strategies and 
conditional execution. Explain the trade-offs between comprehensive testing and 
build performance."
```

### **Sample GitHub Actions Solution**

```yaml

    - name: Upload test results
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      if: always()
      with:
        name: test-results-${{ matrix.os }}
        path: '**/test-results.trx'
        
    - name: Upload coverage reports
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:

        path: '**/coverage.cobertura.xml'

  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
    - name: Run CodeQL Analysis
      uses: github/codeql-action/init@v3

### **Key Teaching Points**

**‚úÖ Strong Student Approaches:**
- Analyzes application requirements before designing pipeline
- Asks about industry best practices and reasoning behind choices
- Considers performance optimization through caching and parallelization
- Requests explanation of security scanning integration

**‚ùå Missed Learning Opportunities:**
- Copying template workflows without understanding the components
- Not considering cross-platform compatibility requirements
- Ignoring security and quality gates in favor of speed
- Failing to think about artifact management and deployment preparation

## üìö **Exercise 2: Multi-Platform Builds (25 minutes)**

### **Advanced Matrix Strategy Prompts**

#### **Intelligent Matrix Design**
```
"Help me design a matrix build strategy that balances comprehensive platform coverage 
with cost efficiency. I need to test across multiple .NET versions and operating 
systems, but I want to avoid redundant testing. What criteria should I use to 
determine the optimal matrix configuration?"
```

#### **Performance Optimization Focus**
```
"Create a sophisticated caching and optimization strategy for my multi-platform CI 
pipeline. Include dependency caching, build output caching, and strategies for 
sharing cache data between matrix jobs. Explain how to measure and validate 
caching effectiveness."
```
