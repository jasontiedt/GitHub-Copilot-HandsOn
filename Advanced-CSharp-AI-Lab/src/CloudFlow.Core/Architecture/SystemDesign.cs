/// CHALLENGE 1: Design a high-throughput workflow orchestration architecture
/// 
/// BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS:
/// - Handle 10,000+ concurrent workflows
/// - Sub-100ms response times for workflow operations
/// - Event sourcing for audit and replay capabilities
/// - CQRS for optimal read/write performance
/// - Distributed processing across multiple nodes
/// 
/// TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS:
/// - Must use .NET 8 features for optimal performance
/// - Memory allocation should be minimal in hot paths
/// - Should support eventual consistency patterns
/// - Must be testable and maintainable
/// 
/// AI PROMPTING GUIDE:
/// Ask AI: "Design a CQRS + Event Sourcing architecture for a high-throughput 
/// workflow orchestration system. Include aggregate roots, command/query handlers, 
/// event store design, and performance optimization strategies."
