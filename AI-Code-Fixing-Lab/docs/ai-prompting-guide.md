```

## üõ†Ô∏è Fix-Specific Prompts

### Algorithm Optimization
```
"This [describe algorithm] is too slow. 
Current complexity appears to be O(n¬≤).
Can you suggest a more efficient algorithm with better time complexity?
Please explain the approach and provide implementation."
```

### Security Hardening
```
"This code has SQL injection vulnerability due to string concatenation.
Show me how to fix it using parameterized queries.
Also review for any other security issues and provide secure alternatives."

```
"This code blocks threads by using .Result on async methods.
Convert it to proper async/await pattern.
Ensure the entire call chain is made async correctly."
```

### Resource Management
```
"This code doesn't properly dispose resources and may leak memory.
Show me how to implement proper resource cleanup using 'using' statements.
Include error handling that ensures cleanup occurs."
```

### Phase 2: Implementation
```
"Now help me implement the fixes:
1. Start with [highest priority issue]
2. Show the corrected code with explanations
3. Highlight what changed and why
4. Ensure the fix doesn't introduce new problems"
```

### Phase 3: Validation
```
"Review my fixed code:
1. Verify the original issues are resolved
2. Check for any new issues introduced
3. Confirm it follows best practices
4. Suggest unit tests to prevent regression"
```

## üé® Language-Specific Prompts
