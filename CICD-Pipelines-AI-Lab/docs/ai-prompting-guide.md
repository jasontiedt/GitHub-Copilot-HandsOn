# AI Prompting Guide for CI/CD Pipelines ü§ñ

Master the art of generating and optimizing CI/CD pipelines with AI assistance. This guide provides proven strategies for effective pipeline development with GitHub Copilot.

## üéØ Core Prompting Principles

### 1. **Be Specific About Technology Stack**
Instead of generic requests, specify your exact technology stack:

‚ùå **Poor**: "Create a build pipeline"
‚úÖ **Good**: "Create a GitHub Actions workflow for a .NET 8 Web API with Entity Framework, including unit tests, integration tests, and deployment to Azure App Service"

### 2. **Include Pipeline Requirements**
Help AI understand the complete workflow:

‚ùå **Poor**: "Add deployment"
‚úÖ **Good**: "Add deployment to staging and production environments with manual approval gate for production, health checks after deployment, and automatic rollback on failure"

### 3. **Request Best Practices**
Always ask for industry standards:

‚ùå **Poor**: "Add security scanning"
‚úÖ **Good**: "Add comprehensive security scanning including SAST with CodeQL, dependency scanning, secret detection, and container vulnerability scanning following DevSecOps best practices"

## üèóÔ∏è Platform-Specific Pipeline Prompts
