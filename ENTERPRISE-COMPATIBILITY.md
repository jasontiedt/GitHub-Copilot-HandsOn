### ‚ùå **Requires Additional Setup (Enterprise IT Assistance)**

#### **7. Terraform AI Lab**
- ‚ùå **Requirements**: Terraform binary + Cloud CLI tools + Cloud accounts
- ‚ùå **Enterprise barriers**: 
  - May need admin rights to install Terraform
  - Requires cloud service accounts and credentials
  - May conflict with enterprise security policies
- ‚úÖ **Workaround**: Can learn syntax and concepts without actual cloud deployment

**Enterprise Setup Requirements:**
```bash
# Required installations (may need IT assistance):
# 1. Terraform binary
# 2. Cloud CLI (aws, az, gcloud)
# 3. Cloud service accounts and credentials
# 4. Possible firewall/proxy configuration
```

**Learning Without Full Setup:**
- **Infrastructure as Code concepts**: 100% applicable

## üéØ **Recommendations for Enterprise Deployment**

### **Phase 1: Immediate Deployment (No IT Support Needed)**

Deploy these labs immediately on any enterprise .NET development laptop:

1. **Copilot Mastery Lab** - Perfect starting point for AI-assisted development
2. **xUnit AI Lab** - Essential testing skills with AI assistance
3. **AI Code Fixing Lab** - Practical debugging and code quality practice
4. **Game Code Fixing Lab** - Advanced problem-solving and refactoring

**Total Learning Time**: 8-15 hours of high-value AI skills training

### **Phase 2: Enhanced Experience (Minimal IT Support)**

Request these simple additions from IT:
