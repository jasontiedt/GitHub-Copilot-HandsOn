## üîß Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

**Build Errors**:
- Ensure .NET 8.0 SDK is installed
- Check project references are correct
- Verify NuGet packages restored properly

**Test Failures**:
- Review assertion logic carefully
- Check for timing issues in async tests
- Verify mock setups match actual usage

**AI Not Helping**:
- Review custom instructions file
- Be more specific in prompts
- Include context about the class being tested

### Debugging Tips
```bash
# Detailed test output
dotnet test --logger "console;verbosity=detailed"

# Run specific test class
dotnet test --filter "ClassName=CalculatorTests"

# Generate coverage report
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
```

### Common Questions
**Q**: "Should I trust AI-generated tests?"  
**A**: Always review and understand generated code. AI is a tool, not a replacement for critical thinking.

**Q**: "How do I know if my tests are good enough?"  
**A**: Look at coverage metrics, but focus on testing important behaviors and edge cases.

**Q**: "What if the AI generates wrong tests?"  
**A**: This is a learning opportunity! Debug together and discuss why the test was incorrect.
