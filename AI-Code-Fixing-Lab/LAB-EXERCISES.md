"Combine these multiple database queries into a single efficient query using JOINs."
```

#### Exercise 4.2: Async Optimization
**Method**: `GetDataFromMultipleAPIs`

**AI Prompts**:

## üîç Debugging Tips

### If AI Suggestions Don't Work:
1. **Be more specific**: Add context about what you're trying to achieve
2. **Ask for alternatives**: "What are other ways to solve this problem?"
3. **Request explanations**: "Why is this approach better than the original?"
4. **Iterate**: "This solution has issue X, how can we fix it?"

### Common Issues:
- **Namespace problems**: Ask AI to add missing using statements
- **Compilation errors**: Share the exact error message with AI
- **Logic errors**: Describe the expected vs actual behavior
