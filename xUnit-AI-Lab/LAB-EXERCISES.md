# xUnit Testing Lab Exercises - Step by Step Guide

**‚è±Ô∏è Duration**: 1-1.5 hours | **üìä Difficulty**: Beginner to Intermediate

## üöÄ Exercise 1: Basic Calculator Tests (20 minutes)

### Goal
Learn basic xUnit testing patterns and develop your own AI prompting skills for test generation.

### Steps
1. **Examine existing tests** in `CalculatorTests.cs`
2. **Run the tests** to see current coverage:
   ```bash
   dotnet test --logger "console;verbosity=detailed"
   ```

3. **ü§ñ Your AI Challenge**: Use your own prompts to add missing tests
   - Look at the `Calculator.Divide` method - what edge cases need testing?
   - Think about the `Calculator.Multiply` method - what scenarios should be covered?
   - **Try writing your own prompts first** before looking at the hints below!
   
   üí° **Your Task**: Create tests for:
   - Division edge cases (large numbers, small decimals, zero scenarios)
   - Multiplication with different number combinations
   - Use both regular `[Fact]` tests and `[Theory]` tests with `[InlineData]`

4. **Verify your tests pass**:
   ```bash
   dotnet test tests/Library.Tests/CalculatorTests.cs
   ```

1. **Start with an empty test file** (`ShoppingCartTests.cs` has minimal content)

2. **ü§ñ Your AI Challenge**: Create a complete test suite using TDD principles
   
   **Think about the ShoppingCart functionality**:
   - How should an empty cart behave?
   - What happens when you add/remove items?

   - What edge cases exist?

3. **Develop your own prompting strategy**:
   - Start by asking AI to help you understand what to test
   - Request test structure and organization advice
   - Ask for specific test scenarios based on your analysis
   - Experiment with different ways to phrase your requests

   üí° **Your Task**: Create comprehensive tests for:
   - Cart initialization and properties
   - Adding items (valid products, duplicates, invalid inputs)
   - Removing items (existing, non-existent, partial removal)
   - Price calculations (empty cart, multiple items, edge cases)

4. **Practice different prompting techniques**:
   - Ask for test categories first, then specific tests
   - Request both positive and negative test scenarios
   - Try asking for helper methods to make tests cleaner
   - Experiment with asking for Theory tests vs individual Facts

5. **Verify against the existing implementation**:
   ```bash
   dotnet test tests/Library.Tests/ShoppingCartTests.cs -v normal
   ```

   <details>
   <summary>üí° Click here for prompting strategy hints</summary>
   
   **Getting Started Hint**:

   Try asking: "What edge cases should I consider when testing shopping cart functionality?"
   
   **TDD Approach Hint**:
   Try asking: "Help me write tests first for shopping cart functionality using TDD approach"
